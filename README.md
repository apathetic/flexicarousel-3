# Flexicarousel

A carousel that'll dynamically adapt its width: it will grow or shrink alongside a site thatâ€™s resizing via css media queries. Uses CSS3
transforms for its transitions, and is also responsive using CSS

##Introduction

The general idea is that this component should maintain a separation of state and style. That is to say, the Javascript should maintain
the state of the carousel (what slide, etc), while the CSS should take care of the presentation of this state (ie. transitions between
slides, responsive, etc).

##Overview

Featuring a touch-based interface, simple API, and a very-lightweight footprint. It does the basics well, but that's it. No bloat.
You can swipe to drag a slide yet still use CSS to control how the slide transitions will behave. You can also choose to change slides by
using the exposed API. The carousel works on both desktop and mobile, using only CSS to control the look and feel. Under 2 KB(!)
